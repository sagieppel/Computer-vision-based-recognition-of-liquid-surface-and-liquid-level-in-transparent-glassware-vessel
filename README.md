#  Computer vision based recognition of liquid surface and liquid level in transparent glassware vessels (python)
 Get input image containing transperent vessel with liquid (Image)  and a binary mask of the vessel area in the image (VesselMask)
 Return liquid surfaces/levels marked on the image

  Inputs:
  Image: input image
  VesselMask: binary mask with the glassware vessel in in the image

  Output:
  Mask of the liquid surface curves in the image.
  The liquid surface curves marked on the image.
